**Task 1-Iris Flower Classification**

The project involves building and evaluating machine learning models to classify iris flower species. The project employs various libraries and techniques to accomplish this task. Feature scaling and data preprocessing are performed, including splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. The project then proceeds to train classification models using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree Classifier algorithms. The confusion matrix is utilized for model evaluation, and classification reports are generated for each model. The project concludes by comparing the performance of the models and presenting the results in a tabular format. Overall, the project demonstrates the application of classification algorithms for iris flower species classification and presents a comparison of their accuracies.

**Task 2-Movie Recommendation System**

The project involves building a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering and Nearest Neighbors algorithm. The project aims to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user ratings and preferences. After importing the necessary libraries and loading the dataset containing movie information and user ratings, the data is explored and visualized to understand its structure. The distribution of ratings, the number of ratings per movie, and the distribution of movie genres are visualized. Data preprocessing steps include creating a user-movie matrix, imputing missing values, and calculating mean ratings for movies. The highest and lowest rated movies are identified and displayed. The Nearest Neighbors algorithm is used to build the recommendation system.A function to get movie recommendations based on a given movie name is defined, which returns a DataFrame containing recommended movies and their distances.

**Task 3-Credit Crad Fraud Detection**

The project focuses on building a credit card fraud detection model. The project begins by importing necessary libraries and loading the credit card transaction data. Data exploration, preprocessing, and cleaning are performed, including handling duplicates, missing values, and data splitting into features and labels. Visualizations are created to display the distribution of fraudulent and authentic transactions. The dataset is standardized using StandardScaler, and it's split into training and testing sets. Two classification algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression, are implemented and trained using the training data. Model evaluation is done using confusion matrices and classification reports for both algorithms. Both SVM and Logistic Regression models achieve perfect accuracy of 100% in this scenario. The project showcases how machine learning techniques can effectively identify credit card fraud and contribute to maintaining secure financial transactions.
